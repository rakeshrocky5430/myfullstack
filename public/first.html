            Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[24] 
            <br>Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers,
             <br>has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[25]
              <br>Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago,
             <br>evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[26

                A Passage to India emerged<b> at a time</b> where portrayals of India as a savage, disorganized land in need of domination
                <br> were more popular in mainstream European literature than romanticized depictions.

                It<b> is a long established</b> fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page 
                when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal 
                distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like 
                readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use 
                Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web 
                sites still in their infancy. 
                Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
